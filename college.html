<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>

The College is nestled in the green highlands of the Western Ghats, where biodiversity is garbed in the mantle of a cool, misty, and salubrious ambience ideal for academic pursuits. With her focus on job-oriented study programs with an outcome-based, technology-integrated learning approach, Marian is committed to improving the educational standing of the district and preparing students to meet the challenges of the competitive job market and life situations.
